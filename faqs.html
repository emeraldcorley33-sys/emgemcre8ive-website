            <h3>What is included with my Canva template purchase?</h3>

          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Do I need a Canva Pro account to use the templates?</h3>
            <p>Most templates are compatible with both free and Pro Canva accounts. If a template uses Pro elements (e.g., premium fonts or graphics), we'll note it in the product description.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>How do I access my template after purchase?</h3>
            <p>Once you complete your purchase, you'll receive a PDF with a link to the Canva template. Click the link, log into your Canva account, and click "Use Template" to start editing.</p>

            <h3>Can I use the templates for client projects?</h3>

          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Are the images in the templates included?</h3>
            <p>Stock images used in the preview may be included if they are free on Canva. If Pro images were used, you can either replace them or access them with a Canva Pro subscription.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I get a refund on my purchase?</h3>

          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <h3>Can I use these templates for commercial purposes?</h3>
            <p>Yes, for your own business use (marketing, social, client work). You cannot resell, redistribute, or package the templates (or derivative designs) as products.</p>
          </div>

            <h3>I clicked the link, but the template says 'View Only'. What do I do?</h3>
